Custom ROS2 service definitions for SCHUNK force-torque sensor driver.

## Dependencies

Add to your `package.xml`:
```xml
<depend>schunk_fts_interfaces</depend>
```
These dependencies should not be required if you only want to subscribe to topics published by the driver. So you can omit them to keep your packages lightweight.
